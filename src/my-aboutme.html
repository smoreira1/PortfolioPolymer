      <h1>About Me</h1>        
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Stephen. A passionate developer with a focus and high excitment around the full web application stack. 
        It's a fanstisc time to be a developer but also certainly a challenging one. With access to a smart phone becoming more pervalent than some of our basic needs, we have
        obtained an enourmous amount of reach power with a diverse amount of form factors.
        Not only do we have our big three: HTML, CSS, JavaScript; we have mutiple front-end frameworks  and libraries to support our ennormous web applications. 
        Angular, React, Bootstrap, Polymer to name a few. The demand for engineers to be familar with the entire stack is becoming a much more common. This porfolio application is not only for potential scouts;
        but for myself as well. To keep track of what I have learned, what I'm currently learning, and what other fields I would potentially want to work on in the future.
        If you wish to see some more work examples or projects I am privately working on; please visit my github: <a href='https://github.com/smoreira1'>https://github.com/smoreira1</a>.

        The follow sections in the navigation menu to the left explore what I have been exposed to, my thoughts on the technology or my skills regarding the subject.
        Please feel free to read through.
